## Project Introduction



[MLMD](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata)  is an open-source metadata management component launched by Google, designed specifically for machine learning systems to record and manage various information such as machine learning model training, datasets, etc. It can achieve model traceability, repeatability, and compliance review. This product provides an out-of-the-box MLMD based on the Huawei Cloud EulerOS 2.0 64-bit system of Kunpeng servers.

## Core Features

- **End to end visualization of machine learning pipeline:** Support users to upload datasets through a web interface, automatically complete data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, achieve a "zero code" modeling experience, and lower the threshold for ML usage
- **Full link metadata tracking and traceability:** Based on the MLMD architecture, automatically record dataset versions, model parameters, training processes, and output results, construct a complete blood relationship graph from data to model, and support auditing, replication, and problem tracing

The open-source image product [MLMD Machine Learning Metadata Management System](https://marketplace.huaweicloud.com/intl/hidden/contents/0363e40d-0148-47a8-9905-cafad667dd1a) provided by this project has pre-installed the the 1.14.0 version of MLMD and its related runtime environment, and provides deployment templates. Come and refer to the usage guide to easily start an efficient "out-of-the-box" experience!
